# Fourier-Ptychography
//Fourier Ptychography is an imaging technique first
developed for use in microscopes. The technique first collects
a series of images of a microscopic sample of interest. Each
image is acquired under a different angle of illumination from
a coherent light source (typically from an array of LEDs). The
acquired image set is then combined using an iterative phase
retrieval algorithm into a final high-resolution image that can
contain up to a billion pixels (a gigapixel). The technique also
provides a non-interferometric phase image and near
wavelength diffraction-limited resolution.
